## 🔍 Modules Included

- **🧲 Grasp Point Estimation**  
  A computer vision module for detecting grasp points in RGB images – optimized for handling textiles and deformable objects.  
  Outputs robust **x/y/z** coordinates suitable for robotic grippers.

- **🌐 Federated Learning with Flower**  
  A complete FL setup for distributed model training on edge devices (e.g., Jetson, Raspberry Pi).  
  Includes server and client logic, supports offline devices, and enables custom aggregation strategies.

- **🎯 Active Learning Module**  
  Actively selects the most "valuable" unlabeled data points for human annotation.  
  Designed to maximize model performance while minimizing labeling effort.
